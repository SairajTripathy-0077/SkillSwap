                    <p>Welcome to Skill Swap ("us", "we", "or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:connect.skillswap@gmail.com">connect.skillswap@gmail.com</a>.</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                    <p>We use personal information collected via our App for a variety of business purposes described below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>To facilitate account creation and logon process.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>To manage user accounts.</strong> We use your information for the purposes of managing your account and keeping it in working order.</li>
                        <li><strong>To enable user-to-user communications.</strong> We use your information (public profile data and chat messages) to enable you to find and connect with other users, request swaps, and communicate with "swap buddies."</li>
                        <li><strong>To protect our Services.</strong> We may use your information as part of our efforts to keep our App safe and secure (for example, for fraud monitoring and prevention).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. How Your Information Is Shared</h2>
                    <p>We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Public Profile</h3>
                    <p>Your "Public Profile" data is visible to all other registered users of the App. This includes:</p>

                    <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures (such as Firebase Authentication and Firestore Security Rules) designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>

                    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
                    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
                    <p>You have the right to permanently delete your account at any time from your "My Profile" page. When you delete your account:</p>

                        <li>All chat rooms and chat messages associated with your account are permanently deleted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This action is irreversible.</p>

                    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
